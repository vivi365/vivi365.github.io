I am a machine learning researcher based in San Francisco, California.

My goal is to uncover the computational and statistical laws of natural and artificial intelligence, and thereby design learning systems that are more efficient, more automatic and more useful in practice.

I also enjoy dancing and [writing](https://vivi365.substack.com/).
